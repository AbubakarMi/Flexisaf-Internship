## 🔄 **Week 2 Task 2 - Iterator Interface Implementation**

### **Project Overview**
A comprehensive program demonstrating the Iterator interface pattern for looping through lists and performing specific actions such as removing elements based on custom criteria.

### **Key Features**
- **Custom Iterator Interface**: Full implementation with enhanced functionality
- **List Operations**: Remove specific words, characters, and elements based on conditions
- **Predicate-Based Filtering**: Advanced filtering using functional programming
- **Multiple Demonstration Scenarios**: Comprehensive examples for different use cases
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-documented, maintainable code with extensive comments

### **Core Components**
- **CustomListIterator Interface**: Enhanced iterator with additional functionality
- **StringListIterator Implementation**: Concrete implementation for string lists
- **Comprehensive Demos**: Five different scenarios showcasing various operations

### **Demonstrated Operations**
1. **Basic Iteration**: Manual element removal during iteration
2. **Word Removal**: Remove strings containing specific words
3. **Character Filtering**: Remove strings containing specific characters
4. **Length-Based Removal**: Filter based on string length criteria
5. **Complex Operations**: Email validation and transformation examples

### **Running the Project**
```bash
cd "Week 2 Task 2"
javac ListIterator.java
java ListIterator
```

### **Expected Output**
The demonstration showcases:
- Basic iteration and manual removal operations
- Conditional removal based on content matching
- Character-based filtering operations
- Length criteria filtering
